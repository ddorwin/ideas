# Immersive Web Community Group Proposals Repo

## What is this repo for?
This repo serves as a discussion board for early proposals for additions and improvements to Immersive Web functionality.

## I have an proposal! How do I get started?
To get the ball rolling with a proposal, file an issue on this repo. That issue will host discussion for the proposal until such time that it's either given its own repo or closed as will not implement. Note that the issue does not have to have sustained discussion to remain open: It may take a while for some proposals to attract the attention necessary to move forward, and that's OK!

## Do I have to have a spec/explainer/proof of concept before posting an proposal?
No! Certainly if you have any of those available it's great to share them, but it's absolutely not necessary. At minimum you should have a clear goal in mind and a proposed direction for how to address it.

If you *do* have any of these materials available, feel free to submit a pull request to this repo to facilitate discussion. The pull request will not be merged but will serve as an easy way to enable comments and other feedback. If the proposal results in a repository being created, the contents of the pull request may be used to seed the new repository.

## Guidelines for filing a good issue
To ensure that your proposal receives the attention it deserves, there are some basic guidelines you should follow:

  - Do a quick [search](https://github.com/immersive-web/ideas/issues?q=is%3Aissue) for your proposal before posting, and if there's an open conversation please join it instead.
  - Give your issue a descriptive title. "VR idea" will likely get ignored and closed. "Better VR video" is slightly more descriptive, but still very ambiguous. "Efficient video playback via XRLayers" is great.
  - Your proposal should suggest a direction for addressing the issue. Stating "I think WebXR content should be faster." isn't particularly helpful, while "Technology X is now available, which can improve render times. It could potentially be exposed to WebXR like this..." is a much more effective starting point for a conversation. However, please be open to alternative approaches and healthy discussion. (See [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct).)
  - Describing realistic use cases for your proposal is always plus!

## Lifetime of a proposal
The exact path any given proposal takes is highly dependent on the context and scope of the proposal itself, but in general you should expect a successful proposal to go through the following:

  - Open an issue on this repository describing your proposal.
  - Gather support from other contributors, including ideally at least one or two browser vendors.
  - Proposals with enough support and a clear technical direction can request that a repository be created under the immersive-web organization. (Alternatively an external repository can be transferred to the immersive-web organization.) The repo will be flagged as being in incubation.
  - Development of the idea will continue on the repository until it's ready to be promoted out of incubation state.
  - At that point, the idea's repo will either have the incubation flag removed or be merged into another repo as appropriate.
  
## What belongs here vs. in another repo/standards group/issue tracker
There are a lot of different places that ideas for web standards could be proposed, so at times it may not be clear where the best place is to start. There are no hard and fast rules, but here are some things to consider:

  - If your proposal isn't in some way related to Immersive Web technologies (Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, etc.), then this probably isn't the place for it. Consider checking out the [W3C Community and Business Groups](https://www.w3.org/community/) if you don't know of an existing incubation or specification that your proposal fits under. The [Web Incubator Community Group (WICG)](https://wicg.io/) is a good general-purpose venue.
  - Similarly, if your proposal is related to the Immersive Web but useful in other contexts as well (i.e., Geolocation improvements), then it should be probably be handled by a group that's less exclusively focused on Immersive Web tech. Feel free to add a note where appropriate to let the Immersive Web community know about a relevant effort.
  - If you have an issue with a specific spec, open an issue on that spec first.

So what happens if you get it wrong? Nothing bad! We'll point you towards a more appropriate venue if necessary and, when possible, help migrate the issue for you. And please don't assume that a request to continue discussion of your issue elsewhere is a criticism, we genuinely want to ensure that your idea is reaching the right audience!

## Code of Conduct
**TL;DR: Treat other participants with respect or get banned.**

This repository is explicitly for *open discussion of ideas* for making the Immersive Web better, which is best fostered by an environment where said discussion is respectful. As such, every person participating on this repo (and all other Immersive Web repos, for that matter) is expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/immersive-web/need_a_link_here). Please read it prior to contributing.
